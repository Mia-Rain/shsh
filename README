-- $RANDOM in pure sh
---- 100% working
---- not yet implemented

---
What? Why?
-- shsh aims to simply upgrade the wheel, implementing psh-fractional & psh-fc
-- directly into the lang to prevent headaches from dealing with submods
-- this should create POSIX sh with float support!
---- using /ONLY/ pure sh
---
Syntax
-- shsh doesn't run independently, it's a text processing tool
-- it reads STDIN and outputs the 'compiled' shell script to STDOUT
-- Examples:
- cat foo.shsh | shsh > bar.sh
- cat foo.shsh | shsh | sh
